# RandomPictureOfPixels

'''
This app draws small squares that are built together
and formed so called "wall". 
Each square is has the random color,
so when all sqaures together they form one big picture.

The function for choosing color is randomized function, 
that takes list as argument and random number
corresponding to the place in a list is the color for the cube.

The function that draws sqaures in x direction
takes several arguement, such as width and height, size of sqaure, x and y position, list (that is used in random color function).
It draws square when the width approaches particular x value.

When turtle reaches x value it moves back to original x postion
but chabges the y pasition by size of square. 
And the function for x direction drawing squares is called.
It runs until y reches the value of height.


There are several parameters that can be changes 
that outcome of program will also change.
